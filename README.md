### Where am I? ###

XtremeMP is a free stable open-source cross-platform media player and visualizer - written in 100% pure java.  The current version implements only a music player and visualizer. Support for other media will come in future releases. It provides the user with a graphical interface for choosing music files and playlists - and includes support for many audio file formats including .spx, .snd, .aifc, .aif, .wav, .au, .flac, .mp1, .mp2, .mp3, .ogg, .aac, and .m4a.  The code is very modular to allow the straightforward extraction of core modules (such as the audio engine, the FFT analysis, the playlist management module, and several visualizations) to use in other projects as external libraries.

A key feature of XtremeMP is the capability to view visualizations (on-screen graphics controlled by the music’s audio).  These can have scientific/technical purposes such as depicting some properties of the audio (such as the Oscilloscope, Spectrum, Stereogram, and Spectrogram visualizations).  Or they can have artistic expression (e.g., choreographing the “dancing” of light patterns with the music).  As this application evolves, we will add more visualizations, and we would welcome submissions from other programmers showing off their creative expressions.
